## ChatScript
Part of why the output from the Brand Profile Creator GPT is so consistent is due to a programming language I created for ChatGPT called **ChatScript**. It’s a mixture of Markdown and JavaScript, and it works surprisingly well. I'm currently working on extending it and creating the documentation. I'd love to share the rough draft if anyone's interested.

Here’s the added code snippet for reference:

``` ChatScript
if (Financing = 'Public' || Financing = 'IPO') {

**Stock Ticker**

If the stock is public include the exchange and stock ticker.

**Share Price**

If the stock is public include the share price.

--
}

```

*This snippet checks if a company is public or has had an IPO. If true, it adds the stock ticker and share price to the brand profile.*
