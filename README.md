2. **Try the Starter Brands**  
   To get a feel of how the GPT works, you can start with one of the 25 pre-loaded brands. On desktop, you'll see 4 options at a time, but on mobile, you can swipe to explore all 25. Some of the available starter brands include:
   - Nike

   You can request the profile to be downloaded as a CSV. I am also assessing whether to make this feature inbuilt, keeping in mind potential performance impacts. Any feedback on this feature is appreciated.


## ChatScript

Part of why the output from the Brand Profile Creator GPT is so consistent is due to a programming language I created for ChatGPT called **ChatScript**. It’s a mixture of Markdown and JavaScript, and it works surprisingly well. I'm currently working on extending it and creating the documentation. I'd love to share the rough draft if anyone's interested.

``` ChatScript
if (Financing = 'Public' || Financing = 'IPO') {

**Stock Ticker**
If the stock is public include the exchange and stock ticker.

**Share Price**
If the stock is public include the share price.

}
```
